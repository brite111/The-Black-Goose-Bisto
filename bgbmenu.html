				<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
				<p>posted by BGB, November 15, 2016</p>
				<p>
					This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking 
					technique called <em>sous vide</em>. In <em>sous vide</em> cooking, you submerge the food<br>
					into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the 
					food to be cooked to. In his book, Cooking<br>
					for Geeks. Jeff	Potter describes it as ultra-low-tmperature poaching.
				</p>
				<p>
					Next month, we will be serving <em>Sous Vide</em> Salmon with Dill 
					Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before
					November 30
